# 🏗Buidling a basic nueral network from scratch 🏗

Node implimentation of a basic neural network.

Run the index file for a basic XOR example and implimentation.

The network only supports 1 hidden layer at the moment, plans to add more will come soon.

Only 1 activation function is avalible which is the Sigmoid function. Would love to add more activation functions going forward.
